- **Player vs. AI**: Play against an AI with adjustable difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: Random moves.
  - **Medium**: AI blocks winning moves and tries to win.
  - **Hard**: AI uses the Minimax algorithm for perfect play.

## How to Play
Click on any empty square to place your move.
The game alternates between X and O.
If AI mode is enabled, the AI will make a move after your turn.
The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
In case of a draw, the game will notify you when no moves are left.
AI Logic
- Easy Mode: The AI picks a random available square.
- Medium Mode: The AI tries to block you from winning and will attempt to make winning moves.
- Hard Mode: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which explores all possible moves and selects the optimal one to maximize its chances of winning or minimize the chances of losing.
